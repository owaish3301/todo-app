## Features

- Add and list todos

## Tech stack

## Local setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally on Windows (PowerShell):

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd todoApp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Notes

- Replace <your-repo-url> with the actual Git repository URL when cloning.
- If you use a shell other than PowerShell, the commands are the same for Git and npm.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors during `npm install`, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Check with `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- If the dev server port is in use, Vite will suggest an alternate port.
